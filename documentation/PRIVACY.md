# thps.run Privacy Policy

### Note
I (ThePackle) am not a legal-ese person, so I have done my best to ELI5 this for everyone. We do not need complex writing to convey what we do here.

## Nomenclature
*   This document shall serve as the Privacy Policy for thps.run.
*   All instances of "the website", "website", "site", or "we" will be in reference to thps.run.
*   All instances of "you" or "your" will be in reference to any user that uses this website.

## What is Collected
*   We collect email addresses during a private account registration, and ONLY if the user uses email to sign-up.
    *   If you use OAuth, we collect your OAuth credentials from the vendor. This NOT your username and password, it is just a unique token to verify you are you.
*   We collect collect content via any interactions conducted via the website. Most of this content was converted over via the Speedrun.com (SRC, hereafter) API.
    *   Guides are the only user-created content on the website.
*   We collect telemetry to identify and resolve any and all technical issues with this site using Sentry.io.
    *   This EXCLUDES personally identifiable information (PII) such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and browser fingerprints (the only thing given is the browser and version you used).


## Storage
*   All collected user data on this site (to include OAuth tokens) are encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (via strong encryption algorithms).

    *   The website is served via Hetzner virtual private servers (VPS) in Virginia; BackBlaze is where backups are stored and are encrypted.

    *   Any users wishing to exempt themselves and their runs from the site and its services may do so without penalty, restraint, or issue (please see the section below this document for additonal details) and shall be removed within 30 days of notice.

    *   If you wish lodge a complaint at this website, exempt yourself from its services, or wish to ask questions pertaining to this policy, please do so via email: packletwitch (at) gmail (dot) com or admin (at) thps (dot) run.

## Social Media
*   The website provides minimal connections to social media platforms. In the case of Discord and Twitch, they are used as OAuth vendors (see below).

## OAuth Vendors
*   Twitch and Discord (as of 6 Febraury 2026) are the approved OAuth vendors for this site. As such, when you utilize them to login, we are given a unique token that hows you are you, giving you access to more features.
    *   These services are NOT required, and are simply here to reduce the amount of logins you have to create around sites.

## Passkeys
*   In compliance with FIDO2 Alliance standards, you are allowed to use passkeys as a method to log into this site. This will serve as your multi-factor authentication (MFA) method, as well.

## Speedrun.com API Keys
*   To access more advanced features of the site, users are allowed to give their SRC API key. Upon giving it, the site will do a quick check on your key to see if you are you. On approval, your user account and runner account are synced; on failure, nothing will happen.
    *   In either case, the ONLY operation conducted is to determine your status. There is no logic on the website to log this key; after use, it is removed permananetly.
        >[!NOTE]
        >   On success, your accounts are linked and you will not need to re-sync.
        >
        >   On fail, you will be prompted to try again. You will not be able to sync accounts until this is done.

## Exemptions
*   All users utilizing this website - whether it be administrators or users without accounts - are allowed to exempt themselves from this site's leaderboards. When reviewed and approved, you will be added to the "exemptions" list when performing Speedrun.com API checks. Exempted users will not have their run available to view on the site, link to Speedrun.com, collect points, nor be known immediately. Your account will be scrubbed of all data, replaced by "Anonymous####" with #### corresponding to a random number between 1 and 9999.
