### v4 - The [[SOMETHING]] Update
###### Date Unknown

### Major Changes

#### Overall
*   Entire frontend of the website is redesigned. New UI, not basic HTML/JS, and much more!!? This is all hosted on the frontend repo, just to keep Django's complexities separate from React's. (Noami)
    *   New main page!
    *   New game screen!
    *   New login system! (Packle)
*   Migrated the entire API to Django Ninja.
    *   Versioned the API endpoints for future-proofing and upgrading and testing and stuff. (Packle)
    *   GET endpoints are now publicly accessible! All other methods will require authentication.
        *   Roles system has also been added to API keys to manage scope and rate-limiting.
    *   Documentation is also publicly accessible via `/api/v1/docs`.
*   Rebuilt the Guides system to be within the API instead of GitHub.
*   Consolidated the SRC -> thps.run pipeline from two different chains into one.
*   Caching has been added to all API endpoints.
    *   Cached responses last ~7 days.
        *   Upon a run, category, or player account being updated, then this will also update the cached.

#### Points
*   Points Algorithm Adjustments!
    *   If an IL is under 60 seconds, then a different algorithm is used to reduce decay.
    *   Current Formula: `P = e^(4.8284 * (WR/PB - 1)) * max_points`
    *   New Formula: `P = e^(4.8284 * √(WR/60) * (WR/PB - 1)) * max_points`
    *   10 Second IL Example:
        | **Placement** | **Time (RTA)** | **Old Algorithm** | **New Algorithm** | **Differential** |
        |---------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
        | 1             | 0:10           | 100               | 100               |      **--**      |
        | 2             | 0:11           | 64                | 83                |      **+19**     |
        | 3             | 0:12           | 44                | 71                |      **+27**     |

        | 5             | 0:17           | 13                | 44                |      **+31**     |
        | 6             | 0:20           | 8                 | 37                |      **+29**     |
    *   30 Second IL Example:
        | **Placement** | **Time (RTA)** | **Old Algorithm** | **New Algorithm** | **Differential** |
        |---------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
        | 1             | 0:30           | 100               | 100               |      **+0**      |

    >[!NOTE]
    > Yeah, it isn't a HUGE difference, and in some cases it can be scaled weirdly, but the idea is to reign in the crazy curve the shorter ILs cause. Obvious examples are the THPS1 competition ILs, since they are super quick and go by IGT. But, because of that, the point differential is a lot crazier there than it is versus longer runs.

*   Points Evaluation Adjustments!
    *   ILs now give a maximum of 250 points.
        *   The example above used the old system for simplicity.
    *   CEs now give a maximum of 50 points.
*   New Point Streaks System!
    *   Bonus points awarded to world record holders to incentivize optimization.
        *   It is player-based; meaning, if you beat your own world record, the streak stays! If someone beats you at any point, the streak is broken.
    *   Awarded on the month anniversary of the player gaining the record.
        *   Full Game Runs: WR holders will receive an extra 125 points each month for a maximum of 4 months (1000 for WR + 500 for streak max).
        *   IL Runs: WR holders will receive an extra 31.25 points each month for a maximum of 4 months (250 for WR + 125 for streak max).
        *   CE Runs: Unaffected by Streaks.


### Added
*   TODO: Added new login system that allows you to create an account on thps.run and associate your account with SRC.
    *   Logins can be created through the new login interface or through OAuth with Discord.
    *   Added support for token-based one-time passwords (TOTP) to use with your favorite authenticator app or the use of Passkeys.
        *   Contributors and higher are required to have this enabled.
*   TODO: Added new user system and profile editing system.
    *   NOTE: When a login is created and associated to your SRC account, thps.run/THPSBot will NOT update your fields automatically anymore. You can edit them inyour new profile page!
*   TODO: Added new revision to accomodate addition of storing user credentials/OAuth tokens to the Privacy Policy.
*   Added `appear_on_main` field to `Categories` field that will allow for querying only categories that, well, we only want to appear on the main page.
*   Added `archived` field to `Variables`, `VariableValues`, `Categories`, and `Levels`.
*   Added a `Categories`-specific override that lets you force change the default timing method of the category.
    *   THPS4 5th Gen, you're welcome.
*   Added `slug` field to `Variables`, `VariableValues`, `Categories`, `Levels` and `Platforms`.
*   Added a new `/website` endpoint that is more catered to interacting with React.
*   Added Pydantic schema and models.
    *   About time tbh.
*   Added "smart" caches that are generated and stored for 7 days unless data is modified.
    *   This was mostly meant for the React endpoints, but has been extended to all endppoints to keep them consistent.
*   Added new tests and vulnerability checks to the project's CI/CD pipeline to catch problems before they are pushed to production.

### Fixed
*   Fixed all sorts of type checking issues throughout the project.
*   Fixed the logic calculating a run's `points` and `place` fields so they are more consistent.
*   Fixed an issue where the PostgreSQL database would revert database changes upon a restart.
*   Fixed an issue where the returned API request from POST or PUT would (most times) fail to provide a proper response due to a race condition.

### Changed
*   Changed the Guides system so it can be accessible via the Django Admin interface (for super admins of the project), the API via GET request, and the new portal.
*   Changed the API key system so that it will be scoped based on role. Each role has different rate limits (with admins having unlimited).
*   Changed the ordering of levels and category names so they reflect better what is seen on Speedrun.com.
    *   This is mostly hard-coded. Ordering on SRC is done on server-side, so there is no way around that besides either having a "ranking" system or just hard-coding what the order should be. (Sue me).
*   Changed the API so it is separated into "general"/"standard" and "website" API requests.
    *   React will be using a lot of the thps.run API, so separating this will help keep features separate and also allow us to do fancier things.
*   Changed the `/player` endpoint to both return no stats on default and to require the `?embed=stats` request to add stats to the query.
    *   When interacting with larger sets of data, especially when stats aren't required, it can cause slow down.
*   Changed `hidden` to `archive` within `Variables`, `VariableValues`, and `Categories`.
    *   `Archive` will mimic what you see from archived variables or categories. They are excluded from searches, as well, but will help ensure runs do not get orphaned.
    *   SRC's v1 API does not expose this, so it must be done manually (we don't have many that have this anyways).
*   Changed the amount of characters in the `Rules` field of `Categories`, `Variables`, and `VariableValue` to 5,000 (up from 1,000).

### Removed
*   

### Misc.
*   

### TODO
*   Caching
*   [LOW] Fix `Categories` `defaulttime` logic to override the main game when they are different.
*   Fix `init_series.py` to accomodate newly refactored SRC logic.
*   Add new login system and upgrade `Users` model to accept OAuth tokens from Discord, allow for new signups, and require an SRC account.
    *   When synced, SRC account should be crawled to see if the user has any runs in the database; if no, then they are restricted.
    *   TOTP-based tokens and Passkeys should also be added.
    *   Revise Privacy Policy on new guidelines.
*   Upgrade the `website` endpoint with custom APIs for:
    *   Main Page
    *   Player Profile
        *   Run History
    *   Overall Points Leaderboard
    *   IL Leaderboard Per Game
        *   Special version for THPS4 and THPS12CE(?)
    *   Single-game IL Leaderboard
    *   Full-game leaderboard
        *   With pagination?
*   Research caching for website endpoint (~5m?)
    *   Other endpoints would be exempted
