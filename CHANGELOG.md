### v4.5
###### August 28, 2026
*   Added the ability to create and edit slugs for guides.
*   Fixed an issue where, if you select the "New Guide" button in a game's Guides section, it wouldn't auto-populate the game name in the form.
***

### v4.4.3
###### August 11, 2026
*   Fixed an issue where the Celery agents would fail to create a backup of the runner's data, since they were never given full access to the `MEDIA_ROOT` folder it would be housed in.
*   Fixed an issue where `v_date` was being used on when it attained a time instead of `date`, resulting in instances where some runs had no `v_date`, were backfilled improperly, and corrupted `RunHistory`. [#135](https://github.com/thpsrun/backend/issues/135)
*   Fixed an issue where the `run_leaderboard_recompute` function could strip world records of their streaks and points in rare circumstances.
    *   It's always THPS3 5th Gen...
*   Fixed some more `N+1` errors.
***

### v4.4.2.1
###### August 9, 2026
*   Updated `/api/v1/website/main`'s `latest_wrs` embed so it provides the 5 latest world records in the last 90 days, up from 30.
***

### v4.4.2
###### August 9, 2026
*   Updated the `auth/submissions.py` to accept the user's SRC API Key (if given). THPSBot will no longer submit on their behalf.
    *   Before, if you weren't a mod for the game, the site would try to submit through the V2 API. Removing the `players` key from the request fixes it for V1.
*   Updated the `.env.example` file since SRC likes to keep changing the email titles of their 2FAs.
***


### v4.4.1
###### August 7, 2026
*   Updated libraries and backend to Django 6.0.8.
    *   Had to force updated `aiohttp` to `3.14.X` since `speedruncompy` is strictly requiring the new version. Testing showed no issues.
    *   Django 6.1 is out, but waiting for other dependencies to update.
***

### v4.4
###### July 27, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added the ability to declare a timing method as optional.
        *   When optional, the timing method will stil appear on the frontend when submitting runs and on the leaderboards; however, that timing method will not be needed.
        *   This should not raise up timing method errors, from the fuzzy testing I did.
            *   That said, I definitely probably missed something in my testing (I am still working on some different testing methods for edge cases ;w;).
    *   Added some N+1 protections in several parts of the API.
    *   Added an additional check where, if a `Categories`, `Runs`, or `Players` object is not available in the API for some reason, then it will perform an SRC check to validate if it exists before returning an error.
        *   If it does exist, then it is added to the local database.
        *   Note: The most recent validated runs (~25) are returned to the database, however this is a stop gap if it is an older run or player.
    *   Added a check that only refreshes player data states if they are both unclaimed and haven't been updated in 7 days.
    *   Added more capabilities to the SRC API calls to allow for more granular control over retries and backoff timings.
    *   Added Celery timeouts to sweep tasks, since they will sometimes get stuck depending on SRC API shenanigans.
    *   Added a new lock system to reconciliation tasks and sweeps to prevent tasks from doubling up on each other.
    *   Added additional logging to the bot reauthentication to better let admins know if there is an issue.
        *   Before it was silently failing, which made it hard to know that SRC changed their subject line slightly.
    *   Added some new defaults and tasks related to reauthentication and how often they should occur as well as how often reconciliaiton tasks should occur.

*   Fixed
    *   Fixed an issue where changing the player(s) credited on a verified run would not recalculate the leaderboard, leaving the previous player's slower runs stranded as obsolete and the new player's slower runs incorrectly active until a later sync repaired them.
    *   Fixed an issue where a leaderboard recalculation could crash with a duplicate `RunHistory` error (and leave that board's points broken) when a run entered the rebuild while a concurrent verify or sync was running.
    *   Fixed an issue where categories could be re-checked in some situations, resulting in extra API calls or no reason.
    *   Fixed an issue where the database rows would stay locked in some situations, resulting in an error.
    *   Fixed an issue where, if `RunPlayers` is changed, then it would not properly re-check the current database to de-duplicate runs, leaving stale runs and times on the leaderboard.
    *   Fixed an issue where newly (or re-imported) `Categories`, `Variables`, and `VariableValues` containing a special character like `+` or `&` would improperly slugify them, causing issues on the frontend in terms of how to separate them.
    *   Fixed an issue where archived `Categories`, `Levels`, `Variables`, and `VariableValues` would still appear on the main leaderboards.
    *   Fixed an issue where a new run that ties the world record would cause the older world record to lose its streak bonus.
    *   Fixed an issue where SRC decided to randomly change their subject line for the bot reauth email.

*   Changed
    *   Changed a lot of the OAuth coding to be consolidated.

*   Removed
    *   Removed remnants of code related to a different phased approach to reconciliation.
        *   Essentially, I was making it too complicated. I tried to do several sweeps of a leaderboard to catch current, orphane, and obsolete runs, and it just ran poorly overall and ran into a lot of rate limiting issues.
            *   If v2 GET calls are added, I might revisit... But, we don't need it on thps.run.
***

### v4.3.2.1
###### June 21, 2026
*   Fixed an issue where approving a runs on thps.run would not have runs properly obsoleted in some cases.

***

### v4.3.2
###### June 21, 2026
*   Fixed an issue where discovered runs would not properly be pushed through RunHistory and, instead, require a later Celery job to fix it.

***

### v4.3.1
###### June 21, 2026
*   Fixed an issue where the SRC API v2 bot refresh command would be killed too early, making the session stale.
*   Fixed some smaller CSS issues throughout the site.

***

### v4.3
###### June 12, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added a new mobile format
        *   Should scale decently on phones and tablets now - send feedback!
    *   Added lazy loading to a bunch of parts of the site (which hopefully will increase performance?)
        *   Will be assessing this over time.
    *   Added a very basic meta description for the site.
        *   Plan on making this better in a future release.
    *   Added a new `REDIS_HOST` environmental variable to better handle test suites (and to allow custom redis db names).
    *   Added a new constraint to email addresses so duplicates are not allowed.
    *   Added an MFA requirement to API keys owned by privileged users (superusers, game moderators).
        *   Their keys stop authenticating until a TOTP/passkey is registered, matching the browser-session rule.
    *   Added a system check (`api.W001`) that warns when production runs without `TRUSTED_PROXIES`, since per-IP rate limiting collapses behind a proxy without it.
    *   Added a bunch of comments and docstrings through backend and frontend repos.
        *   I am still awful at making comments at the moment ugh.

*   Fixed
    *   Fixed an issue where `RunHistory` was incorrectly dealing with unique constraints.
    *   Fixed an issue where events and notifications could be attributed to `system` instead of the user in question.
    *   Fixed an issue where where runs could never be imported if they had non-subcategory varialbes (e.g. label variables) or newly added variable values weren't properly added, leading to an infinite loop.
    *   Fixed an issue where `Refresh Game Runs` would crash in the admin UI.
    *   Fixed an issue where cancelled reconcilliation jobs could destroy later Celery workers in some cases.
    *   Fixed an issue where the health check was, in fact, not healthy.
    *   Fixed an issue where dependabot was pointed to the wrong directory.
    *   Fixed an issue where the deploy pipeline was pointing to an old backup path.
    *   Fixed an issue where API keys limited to `runs.edit_any` could verify/reject runs through `moderator_action` without `runs.verify` as a capability.
    *   Fixed an issue where API keys could target other games, runs, or guides within their jurisdiction.
    *   Fixed an issue where API key creation would return a `Server 500 Error` when a non-superuser requested `run` or `guide`-scoped capabilities.
    *   Fixed an issue where API keys were not properly checking MFA status of the account in some cases.
    *   Fixed an issue where points recalculations would not reopen a player's next best run when a world record was removed.
    *   Fixed an issue where timing methods could be improperly compared in some situations of recalculation.
    *   Fixed an issue where navbar cache invalidation could cause a crash. 

*   Changed
    *   Changed the behavior of the `Latest Runs` and `Latest Records` logic wherein runs will not appear if it has been more than 30 days after submission.
    *   (BETA) Changed the behavior of Celery scheduling to where, if a game is still being checked, a second scan would not start.
    *   Changed the dev Docker compose file to be bound on loopback port 8001 instead of being bound to the host.
    *   Changed the behavior of the production deploy to wait until the Django container is healthy.
    *   Changed the behavior of migrations/collectstatics so they no longer run against the previous image.
    *   Changed the API key behavior to where, if a user is demoted and they had moderator-specific capabilities, then the key will be revoked.

*   Removed
    *   Removed unused dependencies (`pytz`, `uritemplate`, `django-environ`).

***

### v4.2.2
###### June 8, 2026
*   Fixed an issue where the client IP resolver was incorrectly accounting for the wrong IPs from `X-Forwarded-For`.
    *   The fix hardens how IPs are given to thps.run; before, it was reading from left-to-right on the IP chain and not right-to-left due to proxying.

***

### v4.2.1
###### June 7, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added the `repair_missing_il_levels` management command to fix an issue where there were IL speedruns without a category or level associated.
        *   This was from a rare bug with the v3.X build that I never got around to fixing. The bug was fixed, but these runs were still messed up. Now, they are good!

*   Fixed
    *   Fixed an issue where two specific false positives could be sent to Sentry.
        *   The Celery agents can be recyled via `EX_RECYCLE`, but it would be seen as an error; now, it is seen as a healthy part of the code.
        *   `SIGABRT`/`SystemExit` could be caused by a gunicorn, but the logging integration would incorrectly think that the worker was killed when it was instead idle. Now, they are dropped.

***

### v4.2
###### June 6, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added more title breadcrumbs throughout the site instead of just `thps.run` everywhere.
    *   Added some additional functionality to forward more errors and issues with Celery agents to Sentry.io.
        *   There's been issues with Celery agents hanging, so I need more data to see what is going on.

*   Changed
    *   Changed the "Return to Runner" workflow a bit to make it a little more understandable.

*   Fixed
    *   Fixed an issue where `/changelog` links failed to render properly.
    *   Fixed an issue where the caching in multiple parts of the site was too strict, resulting in stale data for users who (for example) changed their nickname or gradients.
        *   Before, thps.run only accounted for `Runs` based on their `updated_at` field. Now, it also accounts for user customizations.
        *   To do this, had to add a `updated_at` field to `CustomUser` (which is the model account thps.run users use).
        *   This also covers the historical/over-time ranking boards, which are cached the most aggressively (past months never expired): a nickname or gradient edit now clears them, but routine SRC syncs (which only touch SRC-sourced fields) deliberately do not, so those boards stay warm.
    *   Fixed an issue where recalculation would get the wrong game ID and crash, resulting in stale numbers in some cases.
        *   Also hardened the streak recalculation so a board queued for a game that no longer exists (e.g. deleted between enqueue and run) now quietly does nothing instead of crashing the Celery worker.
    *   Fixed an issue where adding or re-adding a verified run through the `POST /runs` (and `PUT /runs`) API did not obsolete a player's slower runs on the same leaderboard, so one player could show several non-obsolete runs (with only the fastest scoring points).
        *   The points recalc already knew which run was a player's best, but the `obsolete` flag was only ever set by the SRC path. The API path now checks for this like it should.
    *   Fixed an issue where a world record re-verified through the SRC discovery/sync agent did not get its streak applied: `points` landed at the base maximum and the streak `bonus` (months) stayed unset.
        *   `update_standings` scored the WR from the already-stored `bonus` but never wrote it, and the discovery path never ran the streak recalc. The single-run sync now chains the same `recalculate_streaks_task` the approval path uses, so streak months and streak-inclusive points get persisted.

*   Removed
    *   Removed part of the reconciliation engine.
        *   Was having issues getting it to work with Celery nicely. Will re-attack this later if the need arises, but thps.run should never miss a run with other measures in place.
    *   Removed `place` and `obsolete` from the the `PutUpdatedSchema`/`PUT /runs` API endpoints.
        *   Placement, points, and obsolete is calculated upon approval.

***

### v4.1.3
###### June 5, 2026
*   Added some additional docker-compose stuff for Fedora/RHEL environments.
*   Fixed an issue where approving a run on thps.run would, in some cases, would fail to propogate `place` and points. 

***

### v4.1.2
###### June 4, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added a new `Resync` button in the `Danger Zone` of a user's profile settings that resyncs their username and URL from SRC.
        *   Your unique ID never changes; but, if you change your SRC username, this will let us resync you to avoid errors.
    *   Added the `Exclude from Streams` button to the General section of profile settings (was in Social Media).

*   Changed
    *   Changed the General profile settings around and described the different username types better (hopefully).
    *   Changed the behavior of the gradient name selection panel to where it shows your nickname (if you have one) OR your username (was just your username).
    *   Changed the behavior of the navbar to where it shows your nickname (if you have one) OR yoru username (was just your username) in the top-right.
    *   Changed the filtering for `GET /streams` to where it will never show a player who has exempted themselves from streams.

*   Removed
    *   Removed the ability for users to modify their `SRC Username` (was `Display Name`).

***

### v4.1.1
###### June 3, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added the ability to use the SRC v2 API for submissions, if the original method fails.
        *   Theoretically, you SHOULD be able to use your v1 API Key. However, if it fails (right now, this is due to an SRC bug where only mods for a game can submit a run), it will use the SRC v2 API.
        *   Runners will still be credited with the run. THPSBot will be credited as the "Submitter".
    *   Added a cookie consent banner that appears once.

*   Fixed
    *   Fixed an issue where the IL leaderboard grid would silently fail if no runs existed within the category.
        *   Now, going forward, if a level is missing runs, it will display that error.
    *   Fixed an issue where runners could submit runs without proper validation.
    *   Fixed an issue where run submission fields would fail to clear its contents on successful submission.
    *   Fixed an issue where SRC-submitted speedruns failed to go through validation.
        *   Forgot to add it to the Celery agents when they performed sweeps. >_>

***

### v4.1.0
###### June 2, 2026
*   Added
    *   Added time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) to the Security panel.
        *   TOTPs are required for moderators of games and super users.
            *   Using a Passkey exempts you from needing TOTP.
        *   Also added recovery code support.
    *   Added a new query option to `/players/search?` that allows you to search for specific Twitch names.
    *   Added a new `/{id}/import-issues` endpoint that allows mods to see what invalidation were raised when the run was imported from SRC.
    *   Added additional logic to remove speedruns that were deleted from SRC.
    *   Added additional checks to Celery tasks so it doesn't re-iterate the same runs over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...

*   Fixed
    *   Fixed an issue where uploading runs from thps.run would fail when converting DateTimeFields.
    *   Fixed an issue where `vid_status` was missing from POST `/runs`
    *   Fixed an issue where POST `/runs` did not ingest `*_secs` and self-create the human-friendly form of times.
    *   Fixed an issue where Celery tasks, in some situations, would call the wrong world record from the wrong category, calculate off of that, and report a point total that was insanely high (one example had a run get 408 MILLION HOLY).
    *   Fixed an issue where PUT'ing variables to `/runs` would cause issues with validation if the run was a legacy run.

***

### v4 - The Definitive Update
###### June 1, 2026

### Major Changes

#### Overall
*   Entire frontend of the website is redesigned. New UI, not basic HTML/JS, and much more!!? This is all hosted on the frontend repo, just to keep Django's complexities separate from React's. (Thanks to Noami for helping get started! <3)
    *   New main page!
    *   New game screen!
    *   New login system!
        *   SRC API Key is required to integrate!
    *   New game pages!
        *   Full-game and ILs have new views!
    *   New rankings!
    *   New player profile pages!?
*   Introducing `Run History`!
    *   Runs have been crawled from the beginning of the community's history to current day to help determine rankings, points, and records throughout history!
    *   Ranking pages now go back to over a decade ago to show the progress of the Overall rankings by year or month, and can be done by game!
*   Migrated the entire API to Django Ninja.
    *   Versioned the API endpoints for future-proofing and to allow better API upgrading as new features/endpoints are added/tested.
    *   GET endpoints are now publicly accessible! All other methods will require authentication.
        *   API Keys can be created by authenticated users, with regular users getting vast GET permissions, moderators getting more, and super admins getting even more.
    *   Documentation is also publicly accessible via `/api/v1/docs`.
*   Rebuilt the Guides system to be within the API instead of GitHub.
    *   Guides are now easily shown on the game's page, and from there you can create new guides with tags!
*   Consolidated the SRC -> thps.run pipeline from two different chains into one.
*   Caching has been added to all API endpoints.
    *   Cached responses last ~7 days.
        *   Upon a run, category, or player account being updated, then this will also update the cached.
*   Categories, Levels, and Variable:Value pairs can now be individually re-ordered dynamically via new Django Action panels.

#### Points
*   Points Algorithm Adjustments!
    *   **If an IL is under 60 seconds, then a different algorithm is used to reduce decay.**
    *   Current Formula: `P = e^(4.8284 * (WR/PB - 1)) * max_points`
    *   New Formula: `P = e^(4.8284 * √(WR/60) * (WR/PB - 1)) * max_points`
    *   10 Second IL Example:
        *   `P = e^(4.8284 * √(10/60) * (10/X - 1)) * 100`

    >[!NOTE]
    > Yeah, it isn't a HUGE difference, and in some cases it can be scaled weirdly, but the idea is to reign in the crazy curve the shorter ILs cause. Obvious examples are the THPS1 competition ILs, since they are super quick and go by IGT. But, because of that, the point differential is a lot crazier there than it is versus longer runs.
    >
    > Is it a perfect system? No. But, I am always up for suggestions since I am NOT a math geek. 
*   Points Evaluation Adjustments!
    *   ILs now give a maximum of 250 points.
        *   The example above used the old system for simplicity.
    *   CEs now give a maximum of 50 points.
*   New Point Streaks System!
    *   Bonus points awarded to world record holders to incentivize optimization.
        *   It is player-based; meaning, if you beat your own world record, the streak stays! If someone beats you at any point, the streak is broken.
    *   Awarded on the month anniversary of the player gaining the record.
        *   Full Game Runs: WR holders will receive an extra 125 points each month for a maximum of 4 months (1000 for WR + 500 for streak max).
        *   IL Runs: WR holders will receive an extra 31.25 points each month for a maximum of 4 months (250 for WR + 125 for streak max).
        *   CE Runs: Unaffected by Streaks.


### Added
*   Added a brand new login system that requires a valid SRC API Key to determine if you own your account.
    *   Runners without an `approved` run will not be able to make an account until it is approved.
    *   Runners can elect to keep their SRC API Key saved in the database or not. If you do, you can submit runs through the site!
        *   API Keys are encrypted in transit and at rest.
*   Added the ability for runners to sign-up with Discord and Twitch, allowing for passwordless setups!
    *   SRC API Key is still required!
*   Added the ability to use a passkey as a method to log into the site.
*   Added the ability to remove passwords, passkeys, and OAuth methods - as long as one valid form remains at all times.
*   Added indexes to multiple models to help speed up load times in virtually all instances.
*   Added `appear_on_main` field to `Categories` and `VariableValues` that will allow for querying only categories that, well, we only want to appear on the main page.
    *   Also added a devoted page to the superuser's `Admin Panel` to help decide which runs appear on the front page.
*   Added the ability for superadmins to adjust the ordering of `Categories`, `Variable-Value` pairs, and `Levels`.
*   Added `order` field to `Categories`, `Levels`, and `VariableValues` that will help establish the order of that model when returned from the API.
    *   Also created a specialized `Manage Category & Level Ordering` Django Action to help admins manage the order of the model objects.
*   Added a new `is_ce` property to `Games` to help centralize determining if the object is a Category Extension or not.
*   Added `archived` field to `Variables`, `VariableValues`, `Categories`, and `Levels`.
*   Added `rules` field to  `Variables`, `VariableValues`, `Categories`, `Levels` and `Games`.
*   Added the ability to see rules in submit and edit run views and on the category's page.
*   Added a `Categories`-specific override that lets you force change the default timing method of the category.
    *   THPS4 5th Gen, you're welcome.
*   Added `slug` field to `Variables`, `VariableValues`, `Categories`, `Levels` and `Platforms`.
*   Added a new `/website` endpoint that is more catered to interacting with React.
*   Added Pydantic schema and models.
    *   About time tbh.
*   Added "smart" caches that are generated and stored for 7 days unless data is modified.
    *   This was mostly meant for the React endpoints, but has been extended to all endpoints to keep them consistent.
    *   Logic has been added to help invalidate caches when data is updated.
*   Added new tests and vulnerability checks to the project's CI/CD pipeline to catch problems before they are pushed to production.
*   Added a new Dockerfile build process to reduce the size of the overall images and harden it for regulatory compliance.
*   Added the ability for runners to delete themselves from the database.
    *   Their run data will remain, but will be marked as `Anonymous`.
*   Added the ability for runners to backup their data to a .zip format.

> There is definitely a lot more I forgot to add! But, yeah, a lot has changed <3

### Fixed
*   Fixed all sorts of type checking issues throughout the project.
*   Fixed the logic calculating a run's `points` and `place` fields so they are more consistent.
*   Fixed an issue where the PostgreSQL database would revert database changes upon a restart.
*   Fixed an issue where the returned API request from POST or PUT would (most times) fail to provide a proper response due to a race condition.
*   Fixed an issue where development servers would fail to serve CSS and Static files on refresh.
*   Fixed an issue where the Django image would be caught in an infinite loop if Celery tasks weren't properly ended.
    *   Celery tasks are a separate image now, still integrated with Django.

### Changed
*   Changed the Guides system so it can be accessible via the Django Admin interface (for super admins of the project), the API via GET request, and the new portal.
*   Changed the API key system so that it will be scoped based on role. Each role has different rate limits (with admins having unlimited).
*   Changed the ordering of levels and category names so they reflect better what is seen on Speedrun.com.
    *   This is mostly hard-coded. Ordering on SRC is done on server-side, so there is no way around that besides either having a "ranking" system or just hard-coding what the order should be. (Sue me).
*   Changed the API so it is separated into "general"/"standard" and "website" API requests.
    *   React will be using a lot of the thps.run API, so separating this will help keep features separate and also allow us to do fancier things.
*   Changed the `/player` endpoint to both return no stats on default and to require the `?embed=stats` request to add stats to the query.
    *   When interacting with larger sets of data, especially when stats aren't required, it can cause slow down.
*   Changed `hidden` to `archive` within `Variables`, `VariableValues`, and `Categories`.
    *   `Archive` will mimic what you see from archived variables or categories. They are excluded from searches, as well, but will help ensure runs do not get orphaned.
    *   SRC's v1 API does not expose this, so it must be done manually (we don't have many that have this anyways).
*   Changed the amount of characters in the `Rules` field of `Categories`, `Variables`, and `VariableValue` to 5,000 (up from 1,000).

### Removed
*   Removed `all_cats` as a field, since new logic helps consolidate field options.
*   Removed `subcategory` from all `Runs` objects.
    *   There is now a dynamic process to show the full subcategory instead of it needing to be updated everytime a category and/or variable is to be updated.
