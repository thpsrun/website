                            <h6>March 24, 2025</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Added THPS1+2 Any% Tour Mode (All Tours, New Game) and All Goals & Golds (All Tours, New Game) to the main page.</li>
                                <li>Added additional logic to properly handle speedruns that have only LRT submitted but not RTA.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>An example speedrun is <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/api/v1/runs/8m78g0z0" target="_blank">neskamikaze's THPS3 Any% - 6th Gen</a> run. As of writing, the link will give you the raw JSON of the run from the SRC API with incorrect data. Even though the front-end has their LRT set properly, the API has their LRT time set to "realtime" and "realtime_t".</li>
                                        <li>This logic is temporary and will be removed if the v1 endpoint is fixed or (more likely) when this site uses the v2 endpoint.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>Fixed an issue where world records sent through the API could produce errors with point calculations</li>

                            <h6>March 23, 2025</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Added <code>idefaulttime</code> (IL Default Time) attribute to the <code>GameOverview</code> model.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One annoying part of SRC is that there is no way to set a specific timing standard (e.g., RTA, IGT, LRT) for full game leaderboards and another standard for ILs.</li>
                                        <li>An example of this is that THPS2 (as of writing) is RTA, but its ILs are set to IGT.</li>
                                        <li>Either I have to do a super hacky job of doing a check for the default timing method for a leaderboard THEN double-check if that is the actual default timing method, just have a billion checks that waste cycles, or I do this. This makes it easier to manage.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Added <code>pointsmax</code> (Full Game WR Point Maximum) and <code>ipointsmax</code> (IL WR Point Maximum) attributes to the <code>GameOverview</code> model.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This is more so for future/historical change logging for me. Eventually this project will be open-source.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Added <code>v-date</code> (Verified Date) attribute to <code>MainRuns</code> and <code>ILRuns</code> models.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>v-date</code> is used to show the most recently approved speedruns on the main page.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Added an additional check for the obsolete run imports that prevents importing runs awaiting review or are denied.</li>
                                <li>Added external links to the approved PARTYMOD and ClownJob'd mods.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>In a later update, resources will be handled better (to include guides).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Changed dropdowns for all categories to be alphabetized.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Need to work on a better system for showing categories (especially showing default categories first).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Changed <code>date</code> in <code>MainRuns</code> and <code>ILRuns</code> models from a regular date field to date and time field.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where some runs that did not have a "submitted" or "verified" date would return as null.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Because of this, the website would return a date of "January 1, 1970" (beginning of Unix epoch time). The games didn't exist back then.</li>
                                        <li><code>v-date</code> can return as Null in some cases from the SRC API. The <code>date</code> field from SRC, however, always returns at least the date it was added to the SRC leaderboards. So, if the submitted date doesn't exist, it will use this date at midnight UTC as the time.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Some ancient runs do not have a date. From now on, those runs will display a date of "---" on the leaderboards.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where runs were not being imported properly if it was from a speedrunner that didn't already exist on this site.</li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where nicknames for players on the "Latest World Records" section of the front page would show up null.</li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where runs with a non-default time would appear as "0" on the front page (e.g., THPS2 ILs use IGT; they were still showing RTA instead).
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Alongside this, the issue where times in non-default categories/leaderboards displaying all of their runs as having the maximum points has been resolved.</li>
                                        <li>For example, THPS2 ILs use IGT for their timing, even though the THPS2 board uses RTA. Since Speedurn.com does not let you choose for different types of leaderboards in the same game, I added extra checks to balance this out.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where obsolete times were still showing up on the leaderboards.</li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where the leaderboard could display IGT runs in the wrong order.</li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where IL leaderboards were displaying "Full Game" in the page title when they were obviously ILs.</li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where profile pictures were calling an incorrect player ID.</li>
                                <li>Fixed an issue where obsolete runs were still counting towards a player's overall total in the overall IL leaderboards.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Removed <code>NewRuns</code> and <code>NewWRs</code> models.</li>
                                <li>Removed a lot of libraries and dependencies that were no longer in use/needed.</li>

                                <li>Changed the URLs for all leaderboards (again) so they make more sense:

                                <li>Updated the flag icons throughout the website to display hover-over text in compliance with accessibility standards.

                                        <li>The otherworldly country known as Valhalla has been added to the list, as well. It's flag will also now display properly.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Updated the API <code>/players</code> endpoint so it can provide a list of users with YouTube and/or Twitch streams.</li>
                                <li>Updated the SQL database's performance with a dedicated solution.</li>
                                <li>Updated a bunch of Models in the database to feature heavier use of Foreign Keys to link data more dynamically together.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This change will reduce on the number of overall requests a bit, while also making it easier to manage for future releases.</li>

                                        <li>Overall board features the average points for runners from a country.</li>
                                        <li>Regional leaderboards also have a brief leaderboard of the top players in that country.</li>

                                        <li>This is only for THPS4 now since there are soooo many ILs to keep track of; this can be easily added to other games as requested.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>Changed the social icons on the navigation bar to be more stylized.</li>
                                <li>[#5] Changed the formula so it only accounts for the highest placed speedrun in Co-Op leaderboards (rip Infinite Packle Points).</li>
                                <li>Changed the profile page a bit to make it more pleasing to look at.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Reduced the amount of white space on the top panel.</li>
                                        <li>Changed the social icons to match the navigation bar.</li>

                                </li>

                                <li>Fixed an issue where names were case sensitive, leading to issues where &quot;username&quot; didn&#39;t equal &quot;UserName&quot; and errors were raised.</li>
                                <li>[#2] Fixed an issue where the entire leaderboard would be shown with no pagination if nothing was searched.</li>
                                <li>[#3] Fixed an issue where the searchbar on Full Game and IL leaderboards would show all points for all runners instead of their specific sections.</li>
                                <li>[#4] Fixed an issue where the second player in THAW Classic Mode - Co-Op would not appear.</li>
                                <li>[#6] Fixed an issue where the tables on the site index was off slightly.</li>
                                <li>[#7] Fixed an issue where the navigation bar would &quot;move&quot; in some cases on larger screen sizes.</li>
                                <li>[#9] Fixed an issue where players with larger speedrun resumes would have drastically slower webpage loading.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This is a partial fix; will attack this again in a later update. TL;DR: there is a lot of data processed on the player profile pages to make sure it is dynamic. Cache will probably be added in the early-to-mid term; more to come.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>[#12] Fixed an issue where ranks on leaderboards would display the incorrect rank whenever ties occurred.</li>
