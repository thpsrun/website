### What the heck is this??
This has been the pet project of [ThePackle](https://twitch.tv/thepackle) for a few years now. In short, it is a highly-customizable, easy-to-use, and curated website that mimics a lot of the leaderboard functionality seen from [HaloRuns](https://haloruns.com). Built entirely in Django (Python), this is the open-source files used for websites like [thps.run](https://thps.run).

### How does this work?
thps.run is essentially a 1:1 cache of the Speedrun.com leaderboards for the [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater speedrun community](https://speedrun.com/tonyhawk). Virtually all runs are imported into custom models that mimic the layout and feel of Speedrun.com's API. From here, we are able to perform limitless lookups, customize experiences and create new features, and introduce fun stuff like the [Points System](#note-on-points).  
  
When you initially setup this project in your environment, you will need to import a `Series ID` into the `Series` model in the Admin Panel (easily gettable if you just take the series ID from any `https://speedrun.com/api/v1/series/<SERIES_SLUG>` request). While this means that ONLY communitys who have a Series for their game can use this project, it will allow you to have greater dynamic control of your community's speedruns.

### But why?
While SRC has improved a little bit over the last few years, every community should be free to create a decentralized leaderboard of some kind. Very large communities (like Megaman) already have their own websites, and this project serves as a way to quickly build one for your community.  
  
Will this work for everyone? No. Can you curate it to fit your community? Yes!

### Can I fork this project?
1.  This project assumes you are familar with Python and/or Django. A lot of processes and procedures are largely automated, but there may be some tweaks that you need to apply for your use case.
    *   Example: Currently, this project doesn't support speedruns with more than two players. If you support a community with more than 2, you will need to take this and curate things.
        *   Later versions will fix this.
    * Another example: THPS doesn't have any game with more than two sub-categories (variables), so you will need to customize things a bit.
        *   Later versions will also fix this.
2.  This project assumes you have permission to use the HaloRuns points system. [See below](#note-on-points).
3.  Contributing to this project is encouraged, but definitely not necessary. Commits to this project are **primarily** meant to enhance the thps.run experience or fix security problems.

### Requirements
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Desktop or Docker Compose is fine)

### Note on Points
The points system utilized within this project was created by ibeechu and goatrope of the [HaloRuns](https://haloruns.com) speedrun community. For the use of thps.run, they are used with permission; if you wish to use this points system, then contact them on their official Discord for permission. This project assumes that you already have permission of some kind to use it, so please ask!

Points (referred to lovingly as Packle Points by the THPS community) is a score given to all speedruns. It incentivites players into trying out different speedruns or categories within the series.

This is how points are distributed when you have a world record:
*   Full-game (non-Category Extensions): 1000 points
*   Individual Levels: 100 points
*   Category Extensions: 25 points

All subsequent runs that are slower than the world record will receive reduced points. It is an algorithmic formula, but here is how it looks with Python:
*   `math.floor((0.008 * math.pow(math.e, (4.8284 * (wr_time/secs)))) * run_type)`  
  
And how it looks in a simple formula: 
*   P = 0.008 * e<sup>4.8284x</sup> * y
    *   x = World Record Seconds (as a float) divided by Personal Best Seconds (as a float)
    *   y = Points based on the type of run it belogns to (see above).
  
As an example of how points are reduced, how is a sample based on if a category's world record is 1:20:00:
*   1:20:00 = 1000 points (maximum for full-game)
*   1:25:00 = 752 points
*   1:30:00 = 584 points
*   1:40:00 = 380 points
*   3:00:00 = 68 points
*   4:00:00 = 40 points
*   5:00:00 = 28 points
  
### Installation
1.  Install the requirements above to your computer or server.
2.  Git clone this repo or download a copy with the .ZIP.
3.  Open the new folder in a code editor and make whatever changes are needed to `.env.example`, then rename it to JUST `.env`.
4.  Through whatever means, `docker compose up` to begin pulling the images and packages.
5.  After it is opened, access it through localhost:8001; if this fails, check system logs. If `DEBUG` in the `.env` file is set to True, then you should see a callback stack of the error.
6.  Follow the [Post-Installation Steps](#post-installation-steps) below.
7.  Either determine the exact SRC ID for your series using the URL syntax in "How does this work" or use the slug for your series name (e.g., Tony Hawk's slug is simply tonyhawk).
8.  Go to `http://localhost:8001/illiad` and login. Afterward, go to the `Series` section and click on the "Add Series" option on the top-right. Fill in the sections provided, then click "SAVE".
9.  Select your new `Series` object, go to the "Action" drop-down, and select "Initialze Series Data".
  
**NOTE: Depending on the size of your community, this may take a while! You should only have to do this once, but this will begin to crawl your community to gather the metadata for EVERY game, category, subcategory, platform, player, and speedrun and import them into your database. You will be heavily rate limited by Speedrun.com. BE PATIENT!!!!!!!! If in doubt, check the Django logs to see if there are any workers reporting issues or updates in the last ~5 minutes.**

### Post-Installation Steps
* Create Super User
  - Super users are required to do anything in the admin portal; think of it as your root account. To create one, you need to access the `django` docker image command-line in some way.
    - `docker run -it srlc-django /bin/bash`
    - `cd srlc && python manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Follow on-screen instructions.
