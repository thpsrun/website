## Code of Conduct
The entire [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/thpsrun/website/.github/blog/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is available for you to read. Essentially, don't be an idiot; this is an inclusive project. If you disagree, just go away.

## Issue Tracking
Before you [create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), please check to make sure you are on the latest version of this project. If you are not on it, upgrade to the current `main` branch to see if it fixes your issues. If not, feel free to submit an issue!

This also includes bug reports and smaller issues; feel free to submit them for review. However, please provide as much information as possible (screenshots help too).

## Security Issues
Please review the [Security Policy](https://github.com/thpsrun/website/.github/blog/main/SECURITY.md) if you have any security or vulnerability concerns. Do __**NOT**__ submit a public issue with vulnerabilities, please!

## Feature Requests
Feature requests are most definitely welcome! All of these will be reviewed to see what can be added to the project and determine what could be eventually added to the roadmap. Again, give plenty of information about your suggestion! Just a single sentence like "pls add blah" may not suffice.

## Pull Requests
If you are interested in asssiting with the project, pull requests are a wonderful way to do it! Feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request if you wish to contribute.

It is recommended that that, for larger changes, that you open up an issue for us to discuss plans. It could be that your idea is already planned, or there may be a reason why it will not work. Communication is key! Additionally, we ask you follow these rules:

-   **Readability**: Your code should be legible and understood. If a code block cannot be easily understood or explained, either refactor it OR add comments.
-   **Documentation**: Larger changes should be better documented. This includes docstrings, in-line comments, multi-line comments, and so on. Again, communication is key!
-   **Python Code Style**: While we are not sticklers on code formatting, you are expected to adhere to style guidelines, formatting, and to give a solid pass to ensure your code adheres to PEP8. There are style guide violations that are ignored; the most up-to-date will be `.flake8` file in the main branch. With that in mind, flake8 is the preferred styler; but feel free to use your own!
-   **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Try to follow the formatting examples throughout the document, and feel free to add some humor to it as well! Be sure to add a comment at the end of the change that includes your username and link to your GitHub so you are credited!
-   **Main Branch**: Please make sure you are forking the main branch!
-   **Commit Messages**: Write a superb commit message! A good commit message summarizes what you did in the subject line, and goes over why the commit is needed. Add additional information, issue numbers, and so on as needed.

## Code Review
-   **Review the code, not the author.** Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.

-   **You are not your code.** When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review personally.

-   **Always do your best.** No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.

-   Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document. 

## Templates
Templates will be added over time, depending on volume of project. If you want to contribute a template or idea, feel free to submit a PR with your ideas!
