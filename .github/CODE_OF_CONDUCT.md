# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

Put bluntly: this project was created by someone who believes in an inclusive,
welcoming, and understanding world. Those who do not agree with any of these
Standards or behaviors will be quickly shown the door - they will never be welcome.

## The Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Attacking anyone for any reason based upon (but not limited to) their race, creed, 
  gender, identity, sexual orientation, disability, or nationality.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.
